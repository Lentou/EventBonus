## üõ†Ô∏è Features:

- Easy to use and setup
- Setting up in-game or in-console
- Automatic given rewards to players

## About EventBonus:
- The EventBonus is for server owners where the server owners forgot to give rewards or compensation to the players

## Example Scenario:
- You organized a tournament on the server¬†and everyone who participates can receive¬†rewards¬†but you failed to give everyone the prize that was specifically designed for them. Using the EventBonus Plugin, the plugin¬†can assist you in automatically distributing awards to participants, so that if a player arrives on a different day, they will receive the reward that they have not yet claimed, without having to ask the owner "where is my reward for attending the tournament?"
